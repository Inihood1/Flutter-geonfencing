Welcome to the Geofencing Flutter App! This Flutter application allows you to set up geofences and receive notifications when a user enters or exits a specified geographical area. Geofencing can be a powerful tool for location-based applications, and this repository provides you with a starting point to implement geofencing features in your Flutter projects.

## Features

- Set up geofences to monitor specific locations.
- Receive notifications when a user enters or exits a geofence.
- Customizable notifications.
- Easy-to-use interface for managing geofences.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Geofencing Flutter App:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geofencing_flutter.git
   ```

2. Replace the following assets with your own:

   - `assets/geofence.png`: Replace this image with an icon or image that represents your geofence.

3. Open the project in your favorite Flutter IDE (e.g., Android Studio, Visual Studio Code).

4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

5. Configure the geofences in the app according to your requirements.

6. Test the geofencing functionality by entering or exiting the defined geofence areas.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following packages:

- [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) for customizing and displaying notifications.
- [geofencing_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/geofencing_flutter) for geofencing functionality.
- [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management.

## Customization

### Geofence Image

To customize the geofence image/icon, replace the `assets/geofence.png` file with your preferred image. Make sure to maintain the same filename and format (PNG) to avoid any code changes.

### Notifications

Customize the geofencing notifications by modifying the notification settings in the code. You can change the notification sound, appearance, and content to match your app's branding and user experience.
